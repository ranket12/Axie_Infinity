ðŸ”¹Why should you hire me?
- I dont have any thing to do, I can assure you that I can focus on your account and farm all needed item and I can play up to 10-12hrs a day if needed, besides, I have 2 phones, I can easily familiarize the game, I already played pc games that are similar to Axie that you will farm to earn gears, I playing that game 8-10hrs a day nonstop, Also I dont have any thing to do so I'm finding for manager, Being a Axie Scholar is full of responsibility and agreement, I can assure you that I can meet your expectation on me since I'm doing piloting also on other games. Also I'm a beginner compiler of ROM (phone system) so I can assure that I can easily learn the mechanics of Axie Infnity.

ðŸ”¹Reason to be scholar
- Again, I dont have thing to do, I can spend my time to your accounts, farm all needed items, Also we are on Pandemic right now, I also need to get passive income to support myself, You dont need to worry about me, I can easily adopt the game and I have a friend that helping me to learn the game itself and last thing I'm just wasting my time for nothing instead of that if you will take me as scholar I can give my hours to your account and grind your account 10-12hrs per day if needed.
