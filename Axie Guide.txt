DISCLAIMERS

This is only a reference and does not intend to harm anyone. 

This will only apply to those people who wants to maximize their Slp gain daily.

Yes , having high MMR gives more SLP but it doesn't guarantee a higher Winrate. 

*Note 
This reference is proven by myself and will be used by my future scholars . 

Thank you and
Godbless Everyone
